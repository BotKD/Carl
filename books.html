        Biological Consequences of Nuclear War,<br> held in Washington, D.C., on October 31 to November 1, 1983.
        The conference involved over 200 scientists from many nations <br> and
        drew together the best available scientific information. Its central finding was the
        phenomenon of nuclear winter: a much more <br> profound and long-lasting devastation of the earth and atmosphere
        than had been believed possible before.In the two principal <br> papers, Carl Sagan presents the atmospheric
        and climatic consequences of nuclear war and Paul Ehrlich summarizes its biological implications.
        Also included is the text of the “Moscow Link” ―a dialogue between Soviet and American scientists
        on nuclear winter <br>―and the technical papers providing the scientific evidence for the book’s conclusions.</td>

        universe around us. These luminous, entertaining essays travel both the vastness
        of the cosmos and the intimacy of the human <br> mind, posing such fascinating
        questions as how did the universe originate and how will it end,
        and how can we meld science <br>and compassion to meet the challenges
        of the coming century? Here, too, is a rare, private glimpse of Sagan’s
        thoughts about <br>love, death, and God as he struggled with fatal disease.
        Ever forward-looking and vibrant with the sparkle of his unquenchable <br>
        curiosity, Billions & Billions is a testament to one of the great

        is reproduced here for a whole <br> new generation to enjoy. In Sagan’s

        generations will look back on our epoch as the time when the human <br>
        race finally broke into a radically new frontier–space.
        In Pale Blue Dot Sagan traces the spellbinding history of our launch <br>
        into the cosmos and assesses the future that looms before us as we move
        out into our own solar system and on to distant <br> galaxies beyond.
        The exploration and eventual settlement of other worlds is neither
        a fantasy nor luxury, insists Sagan,<br> but rather a necessary condition

        Sagan’s collaborator, Ann Druyan, full color illustrations, and a new
        Foreword <br> by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, Cosmos retraces the
        fourteen billion years of cosmic evolution that have <br>transformed matter
        into consciousness, exploring such topics as the origin of life, the
        human brain, Egyptian <br> hieroglyphics, spacecraft missions, the death of

      <td>How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology
        driven lives if we don’t understand the difference <br> between the myths of
        pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning
        author and distinguished <br>astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific
        thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very
        well-being of our <br>democratic institutions.Casting a wide net through
        history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks
        such <br>celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing,
        demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today’s so-called <br> information
        age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction,
        channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations <br>commanding growing
        attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the
        siren song of unreason is not just <br> a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous
        plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms. </td>

        Sagan presents his views on a wide range of topics, <br> including the
        likelihood of intelligent life on other planets, creationism and so-called
        intelligent design, and a new concept of science <br>as “informed worship.”
        Originally presented at the centennial celebration of the famous Gifford
        Lectures in Scotland in 1985 <br> but never published, this book offers a
        unique encounter with one of the most remarkable minds of the twentieth century. </td>
