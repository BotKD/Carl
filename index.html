  <h3>Few Lines From Cosmos</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Whatever road we take our fate is indissolubly bound up with science</li>
    <li>The essence of science is that it is self-correcting. New experimental results
      and novel ideas are continually resolving old mysteries</li>
    <li>Somewhere lost between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home</li>
    <li>We are privileged to live among brilliant and passionately inquisitive people
      and in a time where the search for knowledge is generally prized</li>
    <li>The nature of life on earth and the search for life else where are the two
      sides of the same question – the search for who are we</li>
    <li>Death is never meant to destroy even the most inconsiderable species</li>
    <li>We are like butterflies who flatter for a day and think that it is forever</li>
    <li>An oak tree and I are made of same stuff. If u go back far enough, u will see we had a common ancestor</li>
    <li>We do not ask for what purpose the birds do sing, for the song is their pleasure since they were created
      for singing. Similarly we ought not ask why the human minds trouble to fathom the secrets of heaven</li>
  </ul>
